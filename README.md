# Bird - Discord BOT

This project is a **Discord BOT** written in **JavaScript**. I have used [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

## What I've learned by building this project

- JavaScript syntax
- More experience working with APIs

## Conclusion

- This bot is hosted on Heroku and it is still running on my discord server in my absence.
- The version that is still running has many features taken away intentionally, because many of them have still have bugs and I am no longer working on the project. I have uploaded the old source code files too in this repo, for reference.
- I learned a lot by building this project and that's why I want to continue learning JS.
